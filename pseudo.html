directions --

1. The player will have to guess the answer, just like in Hangman. This time, though, the player will guess with numbers instead of letters. 
Here's how the app works:

2. There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

3. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

4. Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
When they do click one, update the player's score counter.

5. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

6. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

7. When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

8. The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.

PSEUDO

4 crystal images, each assigned random number value between 1-12 at the beginning of the game
a random goal number between 19-120 is displayed at the beginning of the game. 
players number scoreboard is set to 0 at beginning of game
game wins and losses counters are both set to 0 at beginning of game.

when a crystal is clicked, the number value is added to the player's scoreboard.

if players scoreboard value equals goal number value, then player wins (alert win msg). Win counter is updated by 1 and game restarts.
if players scoreboard value is greater than goal number value, then player looses (alert lose msg). Loss counter is updated by 1 and game restarts.
